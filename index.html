            <h1>Beyond the Detail: Censorship at the Gwangju Biennale</h1>

            <p>The Gwangju Biennale was founded in 1995 in a spirit of renewal, transformation, and commemoration. Not
               long before the Biennale was founded, many students and citizens of Gwangju lost their lives at the
               Gwangju Uprising (May 18-27, 1980). The attempted peaceful protest was a reaction to the current
               government, President Chun Doo Hwan, and Chun’s expansion of martial law. He officially took control of
               the government on May 18, 1980, the same day the protests in Gwangju began. President Chun had just
               gained power after a coup d’etat preceding the assassination of the then President, Park Chung Hee. The
               current South Korean president, Park Geun Hye, is Park Chung Hee’s daughter. In 1961, former President
               Park took over the country with a military coup and began South Korea’s aggressive turn to
               industrialization. His administration laid the foundation of the cultural and economic power we see
               emanating from South Korea today.</p>

            <p>Censorship and government control is still a major thread at the Biennale, where a painting concerning
               these South Korean leaders has caused significant upheaval. <a

               part of a <a href="http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20140818000811"

               at the Gwangju Museum of Art (GMA) celebrating the Biennale’s 20th anniversary, the painting is a raw
               tribute to the tragic sinking of the <a href="http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20140723001102"

               last spring which killed nearly 300 people, mostly high school students; it is an artwork created in the
               true spirit of the Gwangju Uprising. When presented to the GMA officials mere hours before the opening on
               August 8, the officials called a meeting and decided to postpone any decisions until the middle of
               September. At that point Hong withdrew the painting. In addition, at a press conference <a
                      href="http://news.artnet.com/art-world/gwangju-biennale-president-resigns-over-censorship-82587"
                      onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://news.artnet.com']);"
                      target="_blank">Lee stated</a>, “I don’t think it is taboo to satirize a country’s
               president…Freedom of artistic expression should not be restricted by the government just because they
               have the exhibition budget under their control” Lee alludes that the government has more say in the
               Biennale than the public may realize.</p>

            <p>The imagery of <em>Sewol Owol</em>, named for the ferry, “Sewol,” and the month of the 1980 Uprising,
               “Owol” (May), implicates President Park Geun Hye’s government and indicates she is still controlled by
               her father&#8217;s legacy. After presenting the original painting and meeting resistance, Hong attempted
               to veil Park Geun Hye creating another version of the painting by putting a chicken head over her head
               (critics often refer to <a
                      href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/31/world/asia/an-artist-is-rebuked-for-casting-south-koreas-leader-in-an-unflattering-light.html"

                      target="_blank">President Park as a chicken</a>). This solution was not satisfactory to the
               Biennale’s organizing body. The reactions of the organization unfortunately reiterate the importance and
               necessity of art like Hong Seong-dam&#8217;s.</p>

            <p>This is not the first time Hong has been involved with political resistance and art. In fact, Hong was
               part of the Uprising that inspired the Biennale. The artist produced posters and woodcuts to communicate
               with the citizens and to record events. Due to his actions, Hong was imprisoned and tortured. Eventually
               he was <a href="https://www.academia.edu/6507687/The_Gwangju_Biennale_and_the_Gwangju_Spirit"

                         target="_blank">named an Amnesty International prisoner of conscience</a>. Despite his
               imprisonment, Hong hasn’t avoided difficult conversations: hence the controversy at the Gwangju Biennale
               this year.</p>

            <p>Hong’s style is simple, a slightly surreal caricature of reality. He clearly conveys complicated layers
               of people and scenes into one massive statement. In the center of the painting, Sewol is turned upside
               down with bodies pouring out of it. Instead of heading towards an abysmal fate, Hong retells the story;
               the passengers float through the seawater in an organized path toward a large, mystical-looking fish (a
              <a href="http://damibox.com/bbs/view.php?id=scrap2&amp;page=1&amp;sn1=&amp;divpage=1&amp;sn=off&amp;ss=on&amp;sc=on&amp;select_arrange=headnum&amp;desc=asc&amp;no=136"
                 onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://damibox.com']);"
                 target="_blank">reoccurrence</a> in Hong’s work). The passengers aboard the fish wave to the viewer,
               presumably headed toward safety instead of the tragic fate of reality.</p>

            <p>The ferry is supported by two large figures in the foreground. On the right, a woman clothed in basic
               traditional attire holds a bowl of kimbap. Kimbap has particular significance in this case because
               student and citizen protesters ate it during the Gwangju Uprising. On the other end of the boat, just
               left of center, a man in similar dress holds a rifle and has an agitated expression. The two figures seem
               to be from the 1980 Uprising, likely showing camaraderie for the victims of the ferry accident. Both the
               man and woman look away toward the rest of the painting on their respective sides.</p>

            <p>The woman looks to the right at a scene of protests, demonstrations, and mourning. To the immediate right
               of the woman, a crowd surrounding a cooking pot represents the community of protesters and the Gwangju
               citizens who shared their food with them. Above that grouping, three Korean <a

                             target="_blank"> sexual slavery</a> by the<a

                      target="_blank"> Imperial Japanese Army</a>. There are only a few left; many have died of old age.
               To this day, Japan still hasn’t apologized for the war crime and because of that, there are <a
                      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wednesday_demonstration"
                      onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://en.wikipedia.org']);"
                      target="_blank">weekly demonstrations</a>.) Next to the comfort women there’s a cluster of people
               in yellow raincoats, the color used by demonstration participants to commemorate the victims of the ferry
               sinking. They hold a sign that says &#8220;가만있지마라.&#8221; According to my colleague Hanna Yoo, the
               literal translation is “‘don&#8217;t stay still/silent,” and the colloquial translation is &#8220;stand
               up and act out.&#8221; The sign is a play on the words of the Sewol Ferry captain to the students and
               passengers. Instead of quickly evacuating the ship, the negligent captain told the students to stay still
               and stay calm. Next to that group, three figures hold candles, which also symbolize commemoration of the
               victims. Further to the right, a ghostly Shinzō Abe, Prime Minister of Japan, looks moribund as he views
               the disastrous nuclear leak.</p>

            <p>Further down the painting, Lee Myung Bak, the South Korean President preceding President Park Geun Hye,
               is satirically portrayed as a fish with a human head. President Lee had an unrealized plan to develop
               area around four major rivers in Korea. Former President Lee’s plan did not consider environmental
               factors; Hong is a critic of the project and the Lee administration in general, depicting the river as a
               woman’s body being attacked by forklifts.</p>

            <p>The left side of the painting is much more aggressive and violent than the right, consisting of a visual
               smattering of scandals surrounding President Park Guen Hye. Almost as a shadow, to the immediate left of
               the man supporting the ferry, Archbishop Yoon Gong-hee leans towards the scene to the left with clenched
               fists. Archbishop Yoon actively works to spread the work of the Gwangju Uprising. Below the massive foot
               of the man supporting the ferry lies former President Chun Doo Hwan. A Marilyn Monroe-like figure, soccer
               ball, and baseball glove surround him, referencing his 3S policy (sex, screen, sport); he created the
               program to distract the people from political resistance.</p>

            <p>To the left of President Park is a collection of men associated with major political scandals surrounding
               the president. Kim Ki-choon, the man in the black suit with black glasses and his arms around former
               President Park Chung Hee, was a key figure in the former President’s corrupt regime and is the current
               President’s Chief of Staff. Just to the left, in bright briefs and brown glasses, Yun Chang Yoon, a
               former spokesperson for current President Park, giggles at a man hanging upside down naked. His gestures
               and the positioning of his hands and mouth in relation to the hanging man’s genitals are suggestive. Yoon
               was accused of <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-22503883"

               current Park administration nominated to be prime minister. Moon withdrew his nomination when the Korean

            <p>The depth of criticism in Hong’s <em>Sewol Owol</em>, goes much further than merely implicating Park Geun
               Hye’s government regarding the ferry accident. With the ferry accident as a touchstone, the two sides of
               the painting suggest an unfortunate cause and effect. The right side serves as commemoration and mourning
               whereas the left side is laden with scandal and questions current President Park’s ability as a leader.
               It reminds viewers of the severe criticism she has already faced after less than two years in office. The
               painting is full of modern and contemporary moments in history connected to South Korea, serving as a
               reminder that history is truly a living thing. Futile loss is still being mourned. Victims still seek
               justice. Memories are raw and in the present. The juxtaposition makes the viewer question cause and
               effect and suggests blame. Despite that, the center of the painting is one that changes tragic history.
               Instead of depicting devastating reality, Hong changes fate and represents victims surviving the most
               recent tragedy addressed in the painting. This can be read as a statement that the accident was avoidable
               or as an uplifting spark of hope for the departed souls and maybe even for the future.</p>
